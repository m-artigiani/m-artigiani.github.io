I share in [Federico Ardila](http://fardila.com/)'s axioms:

Axiom 1. Mathematical talent is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.\\
Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.\\
Axiom 3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.\\
Axiom 4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
